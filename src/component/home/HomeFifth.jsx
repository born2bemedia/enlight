                <h4>Inefficient lead management and tracking</h4>
                <p>
                  Poor lead management hampers the conversion process, resulting
                  in missed sales opportunities and decreased revenue potential
                  for the business.
                </p>

                  Difficulty tracking multiple campaigns across different
                  platforms
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Without centralised campaign tracking, businesses struggle to
                  assess the overall effectiveness of their marketing efforts,
                  leading to disjointed strategies and missed opportunities for
                  optimization.

                <h3>03</h3>
                <h4>Inaccurate or delayed billing for advertising services</h4>
                <p>
                  Inaccurate billing and delayed invoicing disrupt cash flow and
                  hinder financial planning, impacting the business's ability to
                  allocate resources effectively and invest in growth
                  initiatives.

                  Inconsistent campaign execution across different channels
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Inconsistent campaign execution leads to fragmented brand
                  messaging and decreased campaign effectiveness, hindering the
                  business's ability to establish a strong and cohesive brand
                  presence.

                <h3>05</h3>
                <h4>Non-specific targeting leading to lower campaign ROI</h4>
                <p>
                  Without precise audience targeting, marketing campaigns fail
                  to resonate with the intended audience, resulting in lower ROI
                  and wasted advertising spend for the business.

                <h3>06</h3>
                <h4>Inefficient manual processes consuming staff timeÂ </h4>
                <p>
                  Manual processes drain valuable time and resources, reducing
                  productivity and hindering the business's ability to focus on
                  strategic initiatives and growth opportunities.
